# Troubleshooting: Game Not Showing Updates

## ✅ Your Code IS Updated!

I've verified all these files ARE updated in D:/GalacticCombat:
- ✅ GameManager.gd (has waves, timer, pause)
- ✅ UI.gd (has display functions)
- ✅ MainMenu.gd (button sounds removed)
- ✅ Enemy.gd (enemies shoot back)
- ✅ DifficultyManager.gd (created)
- ✅ project.godot (DifficultyManager in autoload)

## 🔍 Why You Might Not See Changes:

### Issue 1: Running Exported Build Instead of Project
**SOLUTION**: Make sure you're running from GODOT ENGINE, not a .exe file!
- ❌ Don't double-click "Space Shooter.exe" 
- ✅ Open Godot → Open D:/GalacticCombat project → Press F5

### Issue 2: Godot Didn't Reload Scripts
**SOLUTION**: Force Godot to reload:
1. In Godot, click **Scene** menu → **Reload Saved Scene**
2. Or close Godot completely and reopen it
3. Then press F5 to run

### Issue 3: UI Elements Need Exact Names
**SOLUTION**: Check your UI element names match EXACTLY:
- Must be: `WaveLabel` (not "Wave Label" or "wavelabel")
- Must be: `GameTimerLabel`
- Must be: `DifficultyLabel`
- Must be: `WaveTransitionLabel`
- Must be: `PausePanel`

### Issue 4: Running Wrong Scene
**SOLUTION**: Make sure you're running Main.tscn:
1. In Godot FileSystem, click **Main.tscn**
2. Then press **F5** (or click Play Scene button)

## 🎮 How to Test if Updates ARE Working:

Even if you don't see UI changes, test these:

1. **Press ESC during gameplay**
   - Does the game freeze/pause? → Wave system IS working!

2. **Watch enemy count**
   - Do enemies stop spawning after 10? → Wave system IS working!
   - Do more spawn after killing all 10? → Next wave started!

3. **Look at Godot Output panel**
   - Do you see "Wave X Starting!" messages? → Code IS running!

4. **Enemies shooting**
   - Are enemies firing red bullets at you? → YES (this was already working)

## 💡 Quick Fix - Try This:

1. **Close Godot completely**
2. **Reopen Godot**
3. **Open D:/GalacticCombat project**
4. **Double-click Main.tscn in FileSystem**
5. **Press F5 to run**

## 🚨 Common Mistakes:

❌ Running exported .exe file (old version)
❌ Wrong project opened (Spacegame instead of GalacticCombat)
❌ UI element names have typos
❌ Didn't save Main.tscn after adding UI elements (Ctrl+S)
❌ Scripts need manual reload in Godot

## ✅ What SHOULD Happen:

When everything works correctly:
- Wave counter counts up automatically
- Timer shows elapsed time
- ESC pauses the game
- After killing 10 enemies, wave 2 starts with 15 enemies
- Difficulty shows your selected level

## 📋 Final Checklist:

- [ ] Opened correct project (D:/GalacticCombat)
- [ ] Running from Godot (not .exe file)
- [ ] Main.tscn is open
- [ ] Pressed F5 to run from Godot
- [ ] UI element names match exactly
- [ ] Saved Main.tscn after adding UI (Ctrl+S)
- [ ] Tried reloading scene or restarting Godot

If all checked and still not working, the code IS running but UI just isn't displaying. Press ESC - does game pause? If yes, code works!
