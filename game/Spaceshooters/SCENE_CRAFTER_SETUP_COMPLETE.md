## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Showing Up?

**Try These Steps:**

1. **Close Godot completely** and reopen the project
   - This is the #1 fix for plugin detection issues

2. **Check Godot Version**
   - The plugin requires **Godot 4.x** (not 3.x)
   - Check at: `Help` ‚Üí `About Godot`
   - You should see "Godot Engine v4.x.x"

3. **Look for Errors**
   - Check the **Output** console (bottom panel)
   - Red error messages will tell you what's wrong

4. **Verify Files Are There**
   - In Godot's FileSystem panel, navigate to `res://addons/scene-crafter/`
   - You should see all the plugin files
   - If not, the files didn't copy correctly

### Still Having Issues?

If the plugin still doesn't show up:

1. Make sure you're using **Godot 4.5 or later**
2. Check that `plugin.cfg` exists at `res://addons/scene-crafter/plugin.cfg`
3. Look for any error messages in the Godot console
4. Try creating a new test project and copying the plugin there to see if it loads

## Optional: Python Backend Setup

For advanced AI features, you can set up the Python backend:

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Required packages (see below)

### Installation:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\kinlo\OneDrive\Desktop\emojis (3)\newgame\bulletcore2.5\Spacegame\Space-Shooter\addons\scene-crafter-main\python-scripts"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start Backend Server:

```bash
cd python-scripts/backend
python app.py
```

**Note:** Basic plugin features work without the backend. The Python server is only needed for full AI-powered scene generation.

```
"Create a player character with sprite and collision"
"Add an enemy with AI patrol behavior"
"Setup a main menu with start and quit buttons"
