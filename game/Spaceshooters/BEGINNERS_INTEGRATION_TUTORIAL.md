# üéì BEGINNER'S TUTORIAL: How to Add Code to Your Game

## üìö COMPLETE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

### üéØ GOAL
Learn how to integrate all the systems I created into your Godot game so you can actually see the changes!

---

## LESSON 1: Understanding What Exists vs What's Missing

### ‚úÖ WHAT I CREATED (CODE):
- 24 .gd script files with game logic
- Mission system
- Wave system
- Health bars
- Achievement system
- And more...

### ‚ùå WHAT'S MISSING (VISUAL):
- UI labels/buttons in scenes
- Sprites loaded
- Sounds loaded
- Visual connections

**Think of it like:** I built the engine of a car, but you need to add the steering wheel, seats, and paint!

---

## LESSON 2: How Godot Works

### Godot Has 2 Parts:

**1. Scripts (.gd files)** ‚Üê I created these! ‚úÖ
- The "brain" - tells things what to do
- Example: Player.gd tells player how to move

**2. Scenes (.tscn files)** ‚Üê You need to edit these! ‚ö†Ô∏è
- The "body" - the visual stuff you see
- Example: Player.tscn has the sprite you see on screen

**To make changes visible:** You must edit the .tscn files in Godot editor!
