## üí° WHY THIS WORKS:

**You DON'T need Epic Online Services!**

Your game already has:
- ‚úÖ **NetworkManager.gd** - Built-in multiplayer
- ‚úÖ **AccountManager.gd** - Guest & account system
- ‚úÖ **ChatManager.gd** - Protected live chat
- ‚úÖ **AntiCheatManager.gd** - Anti-cheat system

**EOS is for:**
- Epic Games Store integration
- Epic Friends system
- Epic Achievements
- Epic Leaderboards

**You're using:**
- Your own account system (better control!)
- Your own chat (already moderated!)
- Your own multiplayer (via ENet)
- Your AWS server

## üéÆ YOUR MULTIPLAYER IS ALREADY CONFIGURED:

**NetworkManager.gd handles:**
- Host/join games
- Player synchronization
- Server connection
- P2P networking

**It uses:**
- Godot's built-in ENet protocol
- Your AWS server (18.116.64.173)
- Port 9999

**No EOS needed!**

A: Yes! AccountManager is completely independent and better for your needs.
