# Website Security Implementation Guide

## ✅ SECURITY MEASURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Security Headers (vercel.json)

The following security headers are now active on your website:

#### X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing responses
- Blocks malicious file type interpretation

#### X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Prevents clickjacking attacks
- Blocks your site from being embedded in iframes

#### X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Enables browser XSS filtering
- Blocks pages if XSS attack detected

#### Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Controls referrer information sent with requests
- Protects user privacy

#### Permissions-Policy
- Disables unnecessary browser features:
  - Geolocation, microphone, camera
  - Payment APIs, USB access
  - Magnetometer, gyroscope, speaker

#### Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Forces HTTPS connections
- 2-year max-age with subdomain inclusion
- Preload ready for browser HSTS lists

#### Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- **default-src 'self'**: Only load resources from your domain
- **script-src**: Allows scripts from self, inline scripts (for functionality), CDN, Vercel Analytics
- **style-src**: Allows styles from self, inline styles, Google Fonts
- **font-src**: Allows fonts from self and Google Fonts
- **img-src**: Allows images from self, data URIs, and HTTPS sources
- **connect-src**: Allows connections to self and Vercel Analytics
- **frame-ancestors 'none'**: Prevents framing (like X-Frame-Options)
- **base-uri 'self'**: Restricts base tag URLs
- **form-action 'self'**: Forms can only submit to your domain

#### Cross-Origin Policies (for /game/)
- **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp**
- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin**
- Required for SharedArrayBuffer (Godot web export)

✅ Bug Report System (bug-report.html)

### Admin Security
✅ Admin panel with password protection
✅ Secure admin page (admin-secure.html)
✅ SHA256 password hashing in game AccountManager

## 🛡️ ADDITIONAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Rate Limiting (Server-Side)
Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent:
- Brute force login attempts
- DDoS attacks
- API abuse

**For Vercel Edge Functions:**
```javascript
// Example rate limiter
import { kv } from '@vercel/kv'

export default async function rateLimit(request) {
  const ip = request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for')
  const key = `rate_limit:${ip}`
  const count = await kv.incr(key)
  
  if (count === 1) {
    await kv.expire(key, 60) // 60 second window
  }
  
  if (count > 10) { // 10 requests per minute
    return new Response('Too Many Requests', { status: 429 })
  }
  
  return NextResponse.next()
}
```

### 2. Backend API Security
If you add a backend API, implement:
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
- **CORS Configuration**: Restrict API access to your domain
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate all user inputs server-side
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse

### 3. HTTPS Certificate
✅ Vercel automatically provides SSL/TLS certificates
✅ HSTS header enforces HTTPS
- Consider adding to HSTS preload list: https://hstspreload.org/

### 4. Regular Security Audits
- Use security scanning tools:
  - **Mozilla Observatory**: https://observatory.mozilla.org/
  - **Security Headers**: https://securityheaders.com/
  - **SSL Labs**: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/

### 5. Dependency Management
- Keep npm packages updated
- Run `npm audit` regularly
- Use Dependabot for automatic security updates

### 6. Content Integrity
Consider adding Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external scripts:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/script.js"
        integrity="sha384-hash..."
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

### 7. Monitoring & Logging
- Enable Vercel Analytics (already added)
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- Track failed login attempts

## 🎮 GAME SECURITY (SpaceShooterWeb/Spaceshooters/)

Your game includes:
✅ **AccountManager.gd**: User authentication with SHA256 hashing

## 📞 INCIDENT RESPONSE

If a security issue is discovered:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Take affected systems offline if severe
   - Document the incident
   - Notify affected users if data breach

2. **Investigation:**
   - Identify the vulnerability
   - Assess the impact
   - Determine root cause

3. **Remediation:**
   - Patch the vulnerability
   - Update security measures
   - Test thoroughly before redeployment

4. **Post-Incident:**
   - Update security documentation
   - Implement additional preventive measures
   - Conduct post-mortem review
